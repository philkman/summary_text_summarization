  TITLE = {Text summarization: an overview},
  ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an overview of Text Summarization. Text Summarization is a challenging problem these days. Due to the great amount of information we are pro- vided with and thanks to the development of Internet technologies, needs of producing summaries have become more and more widespread. Summarization is a very interesting and useful task that gives sup- port to many other tasks as well as it takes advantage of the techniques developed for related Natural Language Processing tasks. The paper we present here may help us to have an idea of what Text Summarization is and how it can be useful for.Keywords : automatic text summa- rization; extracts and abstracts},

  TITLE = {Text Summarization Review},
  ABSTRACT = {With the explosion of information supplied by the growth of the World Wide Web, it is no longer suitable for a hu- man observer to understand all the data coming in diverse languages. With this growth of information and available computing power, automatic classification and summariza- tion of textual data gains increasingly high importance. The idea of text summarization research is to summarize a body of texts by extracting sentences that have particular prop- erties. Review of text summarization such as impotentness, related works, evaluation benchmark etc. In the future, we will propose solution for the limitations have been identified in this paper.},
